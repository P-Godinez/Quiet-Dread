# QUIET DREAD
## Brief narrative-driver horror game

### Project Overview:
Quiet Dread is an interactive narrative game of psychological horror, where the player will have the possibility to choose between a set of decisions and these will affect the development of the story. This project, as it is not large-scale, will have an estimated duration of ten minutes. 

### Instructions and dynamics:
In the narrative, we enter the perspective of our protagonist who enjoys a night that is at first joyful. In the middle of the night, he is awakened by an evil presence: a demon seeking to reclaim his soul. To survive the encounter, the protagonist will have to wait until daylight arrives, and this will be by having a conversation with the demon. 

In the gameplay of the game, the player will have to make decisions. There will be two main ones: to remain silent or to talk to the devil. Furthermore, in the game there will be two indicators represented in percentages: INSANITY and IMPATIENCE . If the player takes paths in the story that involve interacting with the demon, the INSANITY percentage will go up. On the other hand, if the player chooses not to talk to the demon, the demon's IMPATIENCE percentage will go up. The player loses if either of these two indicators reaches 100%. There will be alternative events to and the choices are expected to not have obvious outcomes. 

### Objectives (what it is used for and what it is not used for):
Considering the nature of the game, it is safe to say that it does not have a ludic purpose and is merely for enjoyment. The main objective of the game is to give a fun gaming experience to the user. 

### Additional resources:
The program will also use an additional file (.txt or .csv) to read all the narrative material.
